The Philadelphia based non-profit Ourchive (a digital based archive for artists and activist) re-launch post pandemic June 15. They have choosen me to build their web application which they intend to use as a place to engage with thier community and build more community.
They hope I can build them a site that allows them to share their archive and grow it.
